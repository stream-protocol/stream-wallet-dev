Clicking the **Stake** button on the Stream wallet dashboard opens the Stream [ledger browser](https://browse-streamhub.streamprotocol.org/validators). From here, you can [connect your wallet](./connections.md) and stake your STRMs. To learn how, follow the [staking guide](https://product-docs.streamprocol.org/basics/staking/how_to_stake/).

## Claim rewards

If your account has any tokens staked, you can withdraw your rewards from the wallet: 

1. Ensure you are logged into the wallet.
2. From the wallet dashboard, select **Claim**.

    !!! info
        This will claim the total rewards accrued for your stakes across every validator.

3. The wallet shows you a summary of the transaction. Review it, select a transaction fee, and if you are happy, hit **Approve** to complete the operation.

You should now see the rewards added to your **Total Balance**.

    To claim rewards from each validator individually, see the [claim rewards using the staking dashboard](https://product-docs.streamprotocol.org/basics/staking/how_to_stake/#using-the-staking-dashboard).
