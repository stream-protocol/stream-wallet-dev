The **Stream Wallet**, originally forked from the [Fetch.ai wallet](https://github.com/stream-protocol/stream-wallet), is a generic wallet for interacting with the Fetch blockchain network and other ledgers built using the Cosmos-SDK, and supports the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.

Some of its highlights include:

- Private keys and mnemonics are encrypted (using scrypt) and are stored locally on device. This means neither Fetch nor the websites visited have access to these sensitive data. 
- Multiple accounts on the Fetch ledger and other Cosmos-based ledgers.
- Support for Ledger hardware wallets for enhanced security.
- Native and IBC token transfers.

## Compatibility

The Fetch wallet works on all Chromium-based web browsers, including [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Brave](https://brave.com), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) and [Decentr](https://decentr.net).
